Project Overview: This application is dedicated to students who have already registered to the ToDoolie platform and can utilize the application to get paid for a referral they bring to ToDoolie.

Installation Instructions: When cloning the project and running on VS Code, you have to run "npm install" in the command prompt to install all the packages needed to run our project. This should install most of the packages needed to run the application. Whenever we pushed to Github we had to delete the "node_modules" folder before pushing. We also had to include a gitignore file we recieved from our client to reinstall the packages and ignore some files that we need to run a project cloned from Github. You can see the ignore files in the .gitignore file from our project. Here are a list of commands we used to install everything need to run our project and may not be included in the npm install command. These will be utilized in the command prompt before running the project.

We also have attached the mysql code to run our database.
